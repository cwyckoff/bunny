module Bunny
	
=begin rdoc

=== DESCRIPTION:

Asks the server to start a "consumer", which is a transient request for messages from a specific
queue. Consumers last as long as the channel they were created on, or until the client cancels them
with an _unsubscribe_. Every time a message reaches the queue it is passed to the _blk_ for
processing. If error occurs, _Bunny_::_ProtocolError_ is raised.

==== OPTIONS:
* <tt>:consumer_tag => '_tag_'</tt> - Specifies the identifier for the consumer. The consumer tag is
  local to a connection, so two clients can use the same consumer tags. If this option is not
  specified a server generated name is used.
* <tt>:ack => false (_default_) or true</tt> - If set to _false_, the server does not expect an
  acknowledgement message from the client. If set to _true_, the server expects an acknowledgement
  message from the client and will re-queue the message if it does not receive one within a time specified
  by the server.
* <tt>:exclusive => true or false (_default_)</tt> - Request exclusive consumer access, meaning
  only this consumer can access the queue.
* <tt>:nowait => true or false (_default_)</tt> - Ignored by Bunny, always _false_.
* <tt>:timeout => number of seconds - The subscribe loop will continue to wait for
  messages until terminated (Ctrl-C or kill command) or this timeout interval is reached.
* <tt>:message_max => max number messages to process</tt> - When the required number of messages
  is processed subscribe loop is exited.

==== OPERATION:

Passes a hash of message information to the block, if one has been supplied. The hash contains 
:header, :payload and :delivery_details. The structure of the data is as follows -

:header has instance variables - 
  @klass
  @size
  @weight
  @properties is a hash containing -
    :content_type
    :delivery_mode
    :priority

:payload contains the message contents

:delivery details is a hash containing -
  :consumer_tag
  :delivery_tag
  :redelivered
  :exchange 
  :routing_key

If the :timeout option is specified then Qrack::ClientTimeout is raised if method times out
waiting to receive the next message from the queue.

==== EXAMPLES

my_queue.subscribe(:timeout => 5) {|msg| puts msg[:payload]}

my_queue.subscribe(:message_max => 10, :ack => true) {|msg| puts msg[:payload]}
